# Task7


## Task 7.1: Cytron Cleaner
This task aims to enhance the cleaning efficiency and waste collection capabilities of the Autonomous Planet Cleaner (APC) machine using DC brushed suction system. 
### Requirements:
- Control this DC Brushed Motor using Cytron (which is a DC brushed motor driver) with Arduino.
- Implement a software soft start filter using Exponential smoothing Filter.
##### Q: Does this motor suitable for this application?
Yes, according to the following reasons:
1. DC motors are appropriate for applications requiring significant force, such as lifting and moving rubbish bins or compactors, because they can provide large torque at low speeds.
2. Various garbage collection scenarios can be easily accommodated by adjusting the speed of DC motors, which provide good speed control. The motor's speed and direction may be precisely controlled because to its flexibility, making it possible to move and handle garbage effectively.
3. DC motors can be powered by batteries, which makes them suitable for waste collection vehicles or equipment that operate in areas where access to electricity is limited or unavailable.
4. DC motors generally have a simple design and require less maintenance compared to other motor types, such as AC motors.
